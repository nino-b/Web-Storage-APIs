# Web Storage APIs

## Introduction
Welcome! This repository shows my journey through [Maximiliano Firtman's](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/firt/) "[Web Storage APIs](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-storage-apis/)" workshop. 

## About the Workshop
This workshop covers a variety of web storage APIs, including IndexedDB for storing JSON, CacheStorage for caching requests, and the FileSystem API for accessing the local file system. Topics also include quotas and persistence in browsers.

## Directory Structure
- `/data`: Contains images and menu data.
- `/images`: Contains other images except menu.
- `/notes`: Contains my personal notes from the workshop.
- `/scripts`: Contains all scripts except the service worker file.
- `.serviceWorker.js`: Contains the global service worker file.

## Usage
To run the code, use the command `npx serve -s` in the terminal. Open your browser at http://localhost:3000.
